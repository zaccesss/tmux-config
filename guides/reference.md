# Reference

## Key bindings

`+` means the keys are held together, for example `Ctrl+B` means hold Ctrl and press B. Every
binding below is pressed after the prefix, `Ctrl+B` then the key, unless marked otherwise.
`Ctrl+B` itself is the prefix, tmux's real default, not remapped (see the design notes below).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` and `H`/`J`/`K`/`L` are deliberately two different sets of bindings, not a typo.
> Lowercase moves between panes, a small, frequent action. Shift held with the same letter resizes
> a pane instead, a bigger, less frequent action. `-r` on the resize bindings also
> lets the key repeat without pressing the prefix again each time, holding `H` after one
> `Ctrl+B H` keeps resizing.

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+B` then `\|` | Split the pane vertically (left/right) |
| `Ctrl+B` then `-` | Split the pane horizontally (top/bottom) |
| `Ctrl+B` then `h` / `j` / `k` / `l` | Move to the pane left/below/above/right |
| `Ctrl+B` then `H` / `J` / `K` / `L` | Resize the pane left/down/up/right, repeatable |
| `Ctrl+B` then `r` | Reload the config without restarting the session |
| `Ctrl+B` then `v` (in copy mode) | Start a text selection |
| `Ctrl+B` then `y` (in copy mode) | Copy the selection and exit copy mode |

## Plugins (via TPM)

| Plugin | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `tmux-plugins/tpm` | The plugin manager itself |
| `tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible` | A widely-used baseline of sane tmux defaults |
| `tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect` | Saves and restores the full session layout across a restart |
| `tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum` | Auto-saves the session every 15 minutes, restores on tmux start |

## Settings

- Mouse support on, so a pane can be clicked into or resized with the mouse.
- Windows and panes are numbered from 1, not 0, matching how they are counted on the status bar.
- `escape-time` set to 10ms instead of tmux's default 500ms, so Neovim inside a pane never lags
  behind an Esc keypress.
- True colour (`Tc`) forced on for every pane, so Neovim's own colourscheme renders correctly
  inside tmux, not a degraded 256-colour approximation.

## Design notes

- **Why is the prefix still Ctrl-b instead of the more common Ctrl-a remap?** Most shells already
  bind every Ctrl-letter combo through readline. Ctrl-a is beginning-of-line and Ctrl-b is
  backward-char, so moving the prefix does not remove a collision, it only swaps which readline
  binding gets shadowed inside a tmux pane. There was nothing to gain by breaking the default
  every tmux tutorial teaches.
- **Why a black background and light grey text on the status bar instead of a themed colour
  scheme?** High contrast, chosen on purpose rather than for a coordinated look.
